**Postmortem: Web Stack Outage on January 15, 2024**

**Issue Summary:**
- **Duration:** January 20, 2024, 08:00 AM to January 20, 2024, 09:30 AM (Timezone: GMT)
- **Impact:** The outage affected the "User Authentication Service," resulting in service unavailability. Approximately 20% of users were affected, experiencing an inability to log in during the incident.

**Timeline:**
- **Issue Detected:** January 20, 2024, 08:00 AM
- **Detection Method:** An automated monitoring alert triggered due to a sudden spike in failed authentication attempts.
- **Actions Taken:**
  - **Investigation:** The engineering team initiated an investigation, focusing on the User Authentication Service and associated components.
  - **Assumptions:** Initially, the assumption was that the issue might be related to a recent code deployment affecting authentication logic.
- **Misleading Paths:**
  - A preliminary analysis led to the belief that recent changes in the authentication service codebase were the root cause, diverting attention from the actual issue.
  - Another misleading path involved investigating the database server, causing a temporary delay in identifying the true problem.
- **Escalation:**
  - The incident was escalated to the DevOps team for further analysis and resolution.
- **Resolution:**
  - The root cause was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer handling authentication requests.
  - To resolve the issue, load balancer settings were corrected to evenly distribute authentication requests among backend servers.
  - Normal service was restored after approximately 90 minutes.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**
- **Root Cause:** The primary cause of the outage was a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, leading to uneven distribution of authentication requests and server overload.
- **Resolution:** The issue was resolved by adjusting the load balancer settings to evenly distribute authentication traffic and prevent server overload.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - **Enhance Monitoring:** Implement more granular monitoring for authentication success rates and response times.
  - **Automated Testing:** Strengthen automated testing procedures for load balancer configurations and authentication logic.
  - **Documentation Update:** Update documentation regarding load balancer configuration best practices.
- **Tasks:**
  - **Patch Load Balancer:** Apply necessary patches to the load balancer and ensure all configurations align with best practices.
  - **Training:** Conduct additional training sessions for the team on load balancer configurations and troubleshooting.
  - **Post-Incident Review:** Conduct a thorough review of the incident, documenting lessons learned and areas for improvement.
  - **Communication Plan:** Develop a clear communication plan for informing users in the event of future outages, ensuring transparency.

This postmortem serves as a valuable learning experience, emphasizing the importance of accurate detection, swift investigation, and effective communication in resolving web stack outages. The corrective measures outlined aim to fortify the system against similar issues, ensuring a more resilient and reliable service for our User Authentication Service users.
